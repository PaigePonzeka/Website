      %p
        I fell into the world of computers after watching my oldest brother build his computers. He had always been locked into the world of technology, he always had to have the latest and greatest and technology and the key to getting your money's worth out of such expensive technology is really knowing how to use it. He started teaching me everything I know. I would listen to him explain his computer as he assembled his new cooling fan or started a new build. I decided to build my first computer the summer after my Freshman year. After that I was hooked. I took Computer Science the following year. I had never programmed before in my life, but I knew and loved computers. My brother and I have gone down different paths. He's now a
        %a.external{:href => "http://port25.wordpress.com/"} Senior System Engineer
        and is doing well in the business world. I have pursued a career in creative realm and explored web and game development which, contrary to what many of our relatives think, is not at all the "same thing."
