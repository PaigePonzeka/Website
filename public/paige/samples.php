            <h3>Wordz</h3>
    			<p>Wordz was a javascript collaborative project created as part of a class assignment for Professor Odeh's Game Programming for the Web. The goal was to create a fun yet 			relaxing abstract typing game for even the most basic of users to enjoy. We hoped that the mixture of game play and the various randomly assigned tones for each key stroke would give the player an soothing yet enjoyable gameplay.</p>
