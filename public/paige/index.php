            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            	<p>Hello and Thanks for stopping by. My Name is Paige Ponzeka, I'm currently an Undergraduate student at New York University in New York, New York. I am a Computer Science Major and a Web Programming and Design Minor. I have several passions I have recently discovered through my experiences here at NYU. Since taking my first Computer Science class at the Courant Institute I have know which direction I wanted my career to head in. I thoroughly enjoy Web programming and design and enjoy creating websites and manipulating text and images on my spare time. I also have grown up watching and playing video games with my two older brothers and while they may have accepted that when they shoot a player, it hits them, I always wondered what happened underneath the surface. The fact that in a way video games are nothing what they seem has always fascinated me. The player may THINK that he or she is shooting/hitting an enemy AI but underneath the hood there are countless algorithms constantly running and detecting the spaces occupied by both the bullet and the AI to detect a collision.   </p>
            <h2>A Little About This Site</h2>
            
    			<p>I decided to create this website as sort of a experimental showcase of what I could do. The only way I would truly learn different techniques and skills would be to try it out on my own. First think you may notice about this site is the header and color theme. If you visit it at another time (perhaps in another hour or so) you'll see the theme change and there will be a different header and color theme to refect the time of day that you decided to visit my site. You see, this site runs a javascript code to detect the time of day on your computer and thus changes the .css of this webpage depending on the time of day. I hopefully plan to explain it more throughly in the blog section of my website. So enjoy your visit and poke around and be sure to check back soon!</p>
